Hy's issue list is for bugs, complaints, and feature requests.

For help with Hy, ask on our IRC channel (may take up to a day), Stack Overflow with the `[hy]` tag, or on our mailing list.

If you're reporting a bug, make sure you can reproduce it with the very latest, bleeding-edge version of Hy from the `master` branch on GitHub. Bugs in stable versions of Hy are fixed on `master` before the fix makes it into a new stable release.
